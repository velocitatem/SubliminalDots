# Subliminal Dots
A reproduction of an experiment from the book Alex in Number-land.
## Configuration
You can configure the properties of the experiment with the following properties in the console.
``` javascript
var glob = {
  "count"    : 20,
  "radius"   : 2,
  "duration" : 500,
  "range"    : 0.4,
  "split"    : true
}
```
Open the console `CTRL+SHIFT+I` and modify values as follows:
``` javascript
glob.count = 10 // limits the dots to 10
```
Pattern:

``` javascript
glob.{PROPPERTY} = {VALUE}
```
